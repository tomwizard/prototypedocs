# Markdown Formatting Guide

## Heading One

### Heading Two

#### Heading Three

This sentence about formatting is important, as are these bullet points:

* This sentence uses **bold**.
* This one uses _italics_.
* It is unlikely that we will need ~~strikethrough text~~.
* This is an `inline code reference`.
* This is a link to [another doc](sandbox/test.md).
* This is a link to [another website](https://www.google.com).

ðŸ›‘ Do not put emojis in documentation.

$$formula = 5+66/76(13^7)$$

                          * Fourteenth
                            * I can't imagine we go down fifteen levels, but now we know we can.
