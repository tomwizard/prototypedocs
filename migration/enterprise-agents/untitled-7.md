# Where can I get the Account Group Token?

The Account Group Token is an alphanumeric string used to bind an [Enterprise Agent](https://success.thousandeyes.com/PublicArticlePage?articleIdParam=kA0E0000000CmnbKAC_What-is-an-Enterprise-Agent?) to a specific Account Group. The Account Group Token is not a password which must be kept secret.

The token can be retrieved in two different views in the app, as illustrated in the following sections.

## Account Settings Page

The Account Group Token can be found in the [Account Settings](https://app.thousandeyes.com/settings/account/?section=accountgroups) page of the app, in the **Account Groups** tab \(1\):

In order for the Account Groups tab to be visible, the user needs to have the [Organization Admin role](https://success.thousandeyes.com/PublicArticlePage?articleIdParam=kA0E0000000CmnLKAS_Role-Based-Access-Control-explained), or alternatively, a role with the View all account groups settings permission.

## Agent Settings Page

The second location where the Account Group Token can be obtained is the Enterprise Agents tab of the [Agent Settings](https://app.thousandeyes.com/settings/agents/enterprise/?section=agents) page:  
 

  
First, click the **Add New Enterprise Agent** button \(2\), then, in the subsequent pop-up window, the Account Group Token can be revealed by clicking the **Show Account Group Token for Installation** link \(3\):

The user must have a role with the Edit agents in account group permission to see the Token.
