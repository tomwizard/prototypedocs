# Notification of upgrades, maintenance and outages

ThousandEyes releases periodic software updates and performs occasional maintenance.  While we endeavor to update the system unobtrusively, some changes require us to take offline all or part of the platform, Cloud Agents or other infrastructure. Additionally, unplanned outages can infrequently occur. Customers who wish to receive information on updates, maintenance that requires downtime or unplanned outages can selectively subscribe to emails and to our ThousandEyes Operations Twitter feed.

Updates to the product, which introduce new features and bug fixes, typically occur on alternate Tuesdays, starting at 6 PM, Pacific time, but may also occur at other times. We post Release Updates to the Release Notes section of the [Customer Success Center's](https://success.thousandeyes.com/) Knowledge Base.  Release Updates provide valuable information about newly available features and bug fixes.

When planned maintenance downtime is scheduled, we post an article in the Maintenance Announcements section of the Knowledge Base, as well as posting a message in the Notifications feature of the platform.  The Notifications feature is accessed through the bell icon on the menu bar of the platform's web interface:
