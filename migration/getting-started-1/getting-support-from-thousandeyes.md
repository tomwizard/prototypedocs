# Getting support from ThousandEyes

There are a number of ways to contact us when requesting assistance from the ThousandEyes Customer Success team. Depending on your needs and the information exchanged, one method may be preferable to others. Additionally, knowing in advance what information the Customer Success team requires for different types of problems can inform the choice of contact method. Moreover, providing necessary information, particularly at first contact, can reduce the time spent by both you and the Customer Success team in resolving questions or problems.

This article describes the methods available for customers to contact the ThousandEyes Customer Success team, the types of assistance provided by the Customer Success team, and outlines the types of information needed by our team when addressing different categories of questions or problems.

## [What support we provide]()

 ThousandEyes provides a searchable Knowledge Base of commonly needed information, located at [https://success.thousandeyes.com](https://success.thousandeyes.com/). Users are encouraged to check the Knowledge Base for useful information prior to submitting a support request. The Knowledge Base may have the answer you need! If not, users may still gain valuable context to better describe their needs to us. If your question has no relevant articles in the Knowledge Base, let us know in your request so that we can either expand an existing article or create a new one.

For questions which aren't answered in our Knowledge Base, Customer Success provides technical support to customers who have existing accounts for the ThousandEyes application. Support requests can address the following:

* Questions about product functionality
* Configuration assistance
* Requests to analyze test results
* Reports of possible bugs or other platform issues
* Feature requests

 The scope of assistance will normally be focused on single issues. Requests submitted covering multiple subject areas may be split into separate support cases as necessary. Customers requiring extensive assistance in learning how to use the product, interpreting results or performing configuration of the product may require a referral to our Professional Services team.

Some things that can't be obtained from a support request:

* Pricing information
* Purchase of Enterprise Agent, Endpoint Agents or Device Layer licences, or additional units
* New trial accounts or extensions of existing accounts
* Product demonstrations
* Changes to configuration or account information for which the requestor lacks privilege

 For these and other sales-related issues, we can put you in touch with your ThousandEyes Account Manager, Solutions Engineer or other contacts within our Sales team, or with your company’s internal ThousandEyes contact.

## [Ways to contact Customer Success]()

Customers can contact the ThousandEyes Customer Success team 24 hours a day, 7 days a week through email, chat app and via the web at our support portal. All contacts will be logged in a case within the Customer Success team's ticketing system. Each case has a number of the form "S-CS-XXXXXXX" where XXXXXXX is a seven-digit number.

If needed, we may request a remote desktop session, either via an online collaboration application \(such as Cisco Webex or Zoom\) or with a remote desktop application used by your organization.

### [Email]()

 Email is a good choice when providing high volumes of text information, such as large sections of log files, multiple screenshots or similar attachments. 

The Customer Success team can be reached at [support@thousandeyes.com](mailto:support@thousandeyes.com). When emailing Customer Success, users should ideally send email from the account which is used to log into the ThousandEyes application \(app.thousandeyes.com\) in order to ensure that we can associate the sending email address with the correct organization and case history in our ticketing system. If you need to receive email at an address other than the one you use to log into the application, let us know in the email.

Also, if the email address associated with a ThousandEyes account is used by multiple people, such as noc@example.com, please include your name in the body of the email \(such as in an email signature\) so that we know which person on your team has contacted us.

Additional people can be included in an email to us via the CC option. Our ticketing system will add all CC'd email addresses to the support case, so that subsequent responses will be sent to those CC'd on the initial request, and will be notified of case updates.

Email responses from us use an ID tag at the bottom of the email to associate future responses with the existing case. The ID tag has the form:

```text
Please do not remove this tag: [ref:_00ABCDeFg._1234567hIJk:ref]
```

Please avoid deleting this tag from your email responses, if possible. Email replies which do not have the ID tag will result in new cases being opened. Multiple cases opened for a single issue can be merged into one case by Customer Success, but to avoid confusion over the correct case number, email replies should contain the ID tag if possible.

### [Live Chat]()

 For customers seeking interactive support, the ThousandEyes app provides a live chat client, which can be accessed from the **Help & Support** menu in the top navigation bar:

IMAGE MISSING

 Selecting the "Chat with Support" option will display a chat window.

IMAGE MISSING

Begin by typing and end with the Return key to send. Once the chat has begun, files can also be sent by dragging and dropping a file on the chat client. When the chat has ended, the chat transcript is automatically generated and emailed to the user at the email address used to log into the ThousandEyes app.

### [Web]()

 Customers who log into the ThousandEyes app have easy access to the support portal [https://success.thousandeyes.com](https://success.thousandeyes.com/), which provides support case creation, as well as displaying their support case history and other support information. Additionally, web access can be used by customers whose organizations block live chat and/or email due to security requirements.

Access the portal from from the Help icon in the top navigation bar:

IMAGE MISSING

 Selecting the "Contact Support" option will display the customer's support portal page. Select the Cases tab to open a support case or view existing cases:

### [Online Collaboration]()

 Our team may request a screen sharing session to facilitate the handling of your request. The session will be performed using Cisco Webex, Zoom or your company’s screen sharing solution.

#### [Webex]()

 Webex is a browser-based application which allows conferencing via audio and video, and permits sharing of the desktop on a computer running Webex. Normally, Customer Success Engineers use Webex when we need to view a customer's desktop in real time, or to do conference calls, such as with a ThousandEyes customer and a support engineer of another vendor. Normally, video is not necessary, and we avoid using the video function due to the greater bandwidth requirements than audio.

If a Customer Success Engineer needs a remote desktop sharing session via Webex, the Engineer will provide the customer with a Webex URL, which can be shared with co-workers or third parties, if desired. The URL will begin with https://thousandeyes.webex.com, which uses TLS encryption to provide privacy and security for the session \(if the URL does not begin with this exact string, please inform Customer Success before using the URL\). If the Webex is needed for viewing your desktop, be sure to close any applications displaying sensitive or proprietary information prior to starting the Webex.

Clicking the URL will take the customer to the Webex login page, which will request a name and email address. Clicking either the **Join** or **Join by browser** button will start the Webex and present the user with options for selecting audio and video connections. As per above, we don't usually need video and prefer to avoid it to save bandwidth, so select "No Video" unless we've requested otherwise. For the audio setting, normally select the "Call using Computer" to use the computer's microphone and speakers. If the computer cannot support audio, we suggest the "Call Me" option, which will allow the Webex application to call a telephone number provided by the customer.

Webex meetings can also be joined by phone directly, which provides access to the audio portion of the Webex. Consult the [list of access phone numbers](https://thousandeyes.webex.com/cmp3300/webcomponents/widget/globalcallin/globalcallin.do?siteurl=thousandeyes&serviceType=MC&ED=342087012&tollFree=0) per country.  The meeting's nine-digit meeting access code will be required to join by phone.

Basic Webex functionality can be performed without installation of software \(such as browser plug-ins\) by using the **Join by browser** option. If full Webex functionality is desired, software can be downloaded in advance of the Webex to save time, and to ensure that Webex functions correctly. Go to [https://www.webex.com/test-meeting.html](https://www.webex.com/test-meeting.html) and follow the instructions to set up and test Webex on your computer. If possible, we recommend performing the test on the same network you will use when meeting with us.

Chrome and Firefox are the preferred browsers for Webex, but Internet Explorer, Edge and Safari are supported. Full details of Webex's support for operating systems and browsers can be found in the Cisco support document [Cisco Webex Web App Supported Operating Systems and Browsers](https://help.webex.com/en-us/9ehuwu/Cisco-Webex-Web-App-Supported-Operating-Systems-and-Browsers).

### [Zoom]()

Zoom is a collaboration tool similar to Webex, having browser-based and stand-alone clients. See [Getting started on PC and Mac](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362033-Getting-Started-on-PC-and-Mac) for more information on setting up Zoom. Go to [http://zoom.us/test](http://zoom.us/test) and follow the instructions to set up and test Zoom on your computer. If possible, we recommend performing the test on the same network you will use when meeting with us.

###  [Telephone]()

 ThousandEyes Customer Success can be contacted at \(415\) 237-EYES for high priority issues. Callers will be routed to the next available engineer in order to receive the reported issues.

## [Information to provide Customer Success]()

 The following section describes information that will normally be required \(as well as some types of information that we will never ask for\) when opening a support case for various categories of problems. We recommend obtaining this information prior to opening your support request, as some types of information may take time to gather, and may be required before our Customer Success Engineers can begin acting upon your request.

### [Account Group]()

 In addition to information specific to the type of problem, providing the current Account Group name is always helpful, as a user may be a member of many Account Groups. A user's current Account Group is displayed in rightmost corner of the Navigation bar, at the top of the ThousandEyes application:

IMAGE MISSING

In the image above, the user's current account group is "Support".

### [Test results]()

 When submitting a support request about one or more test's results, the best way to provide us information is by sharing a Snapshot link. See the ThousandEyes Knowledge Base Article [Sharing Test Data](https://success.thousandeyes.com/PublicArticlePage?articleIdParam=kA0E0000000CmmyKAC_Sharing-Test-Data#Snapshots) for information on generating Snapshot links. Note that Snapshots do not contain any alert information seen in the full test view, so see the **Alerts** section below for information on referencing alerts.

### [Enterprise or Endpoint Agents]()

 Problems with installation or operation of Enterprise Agent or Endpoint Agents typically require log file information from the Agent, or similar files such as an Enterprise Agent's configuration file. Information on the most commonly needed files are listed below.

**Enterprise Agents**

* /tmp/install\_thousandeyes\_XXXXXXXX.log \(installation of Linux package-based Agents; XXXXXXXX is a random character string\)
* /var/log/te-agent.log
* /var/lib/te-browserbot/log/te-browserbot.log \(for browserbot process errors, and Page Load and Transaction test issues\)

**Endpoint Agents**

Review the sections Inspect Endpoint Agent logs and Share data with ThousandEyes Support in the Knowledge Base article [Troubleshooting Endpoint Agent issues](https://success.thousandeyes.com/PublicArticlePage?articleIdParam=kA0E0000000CmpMKAS_Troubleshooting-Endpoint-Agent-issues).

Problems which cannot be solved solely by inspection of log files, may require a [remote desktop session]() with a Customer Success Engineer to investigate the Agent and the system on which the Agent runs. For Enterprise Agents, we will need command line access via the remote desktop to the Enterprise Agent. Normally, this means having an SSH client available to access the Agent. If possible, before the remote desktop session ensure that an SSH client is installed and configured to log into the Enterprise Agent. If needed, review the instructions for configuring SSH on [Windows](https://success.thousandeyes.com/PublicArticlePage?articleIdParam=kA0E0000000CmnaKAC_Connecting-to-the-ThousandEyes-Virtual-Appliance-using-SSH-Windows), [Mac and Linux](https://success.thousandeyes.com/PublicArticlePage?articleIdParam=kA0E0000000CmnrKAC_Connecting-to-the-ThousandEyes-Virtual-Appliance-using-SSH-Mac-Linux) systems.

### [Alerts]()

 Every alert generated by ThousandEyes has a unique number, called an Alert ID. When submitting a support request about one or more alerts, he best way to provide us information is by providing the Alert ID. See the ThousandEyes Knowledge Base Article [How Alerts work](https://success.thousandeyes.com/PublicArticlePage?articleIdParam=kA044000000CnBqCAK_How-Alerts-work-1476477151762) for information on obtaining and using an Alert ID.

### [Reports and Dashboards]()

 When submitting a support request about one or more Reports or Dashboards, the best way to provide us information is by providing the Account Group \(as illustrated above\) and Report's or Dashboard's URL from the address bar of the browser, when viewing the Report or Dashboard in the ThousandEyes application. Example URL's of a Report and a Dashboard, respectively:

https://app.thousandeyes.com/reports/?reportId=5b6b760a2f868717153c324c  
https://app.thousandeyes.com/dashboard/?dashboardId=5c355df732e569005082074d

### [API]()

When submitting a support request about an API query, please provide the username, URL used for the query, and any XML or JSON data sent in a query \(usually for writing to the API\) via the HTTP POST method. For example:

* username:

  ```text
  jsmith@example.com
  ```

* query URL:

  ```text
  https://api.thousandeyes.com/v6/tests/agent-to-server/new.json
  ```

* query data:

  ```text
  {
  "interval": 60,
  "agents": [
  {"agentId": 113}
  ],
  "testName": "Agent to Server test for www.thousandeyes.com",
  "server": "www.thousandeyes.com",
  "port": 443,
  "alertsEnabled": 0
  }
  ```

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do not provide us with your API token! Also be certain to remove any sensitive information from POST query data, such as passwords for web site or proxies in Web Layer tests, or for authenticated Voice Layer tests.
{% endhint %}

### [Feature Requests]()

 Customers may request enhancements to the ThousandEyes product by feature requests, which can be submitted through a support case. Feel free to tell us what you want in the product! Best if you can also tell us why you want what you want, and provide an example/use case to illustrate the benefits of the proposed feature.

Feature requests can also be submitted in our Communities Ideas forum by users logged into the ThousandEyes application:

IMAGE MISSING

 Additionally, feature requests can be submitted via your Account Manager or Solutions Engineer.

## [Information which should not be provided]()

 Certain information should not be provided to Customer Success. Information from production systems such as user passwords and password-like information should not be sent via email or chat, or exposed during a remote desktop session.

The following are examples of information which should not be transmitted via email or chat:

* Passwords, such as:
  * for your ThousandEyes app account
  * for a Web or Voice Layer test
  * for a private key associated with a digital certificate
* API tokens
* Files such which contain passwords, tokens or other sensitive information, such as:
  * screenshots
  * Transaction test scripts
  * packet captures
  * configuration files \(**te-agent.cfg** from an Enterprise Agent, for example\)

In the event that sensitive information is disclosed during a support inquiry, our team may recommend you make changes to the information to ensure that no security concerns are created for your organization. Always maintain compliance with your organization's information security policies and procedures when obtaining support from ThousandEyes.
