# How to configure Single Sign-On with OneLogin

For the security of your SaaS-based infrastructure and the convenience of users in your organization, the ThousandEyes service offers login via single sign-on \(SSO\). ThousandEyes supports SAML2-based identity providers for single sign-on. There are two steps to set up single sign-on: the service provider configuration, which is done within ThousandEyes, and the identity provider configuration, done within your SSO system.  In this configuration example, we use [OneLogin](https://www.onelogin.com/) as the identity provider. 

## Prerequisites

Configuration is normally simple. Here's what you need:

* ThousandEyes account assigned a role with the _Edit security & authentication settings_ permission
* A SAML2 authentication provider \(in this example, [OneLogin](https://www.onelogin.com/)\)

## ThousandEyes configuration

Follow these steps to configure your ThousandEyes organisation to use single sign-on:

1. Log into ThousandEyes using an account with a role that has the _Edit security & authentication settings_ permission
2. Open the **Settings &gt; Accounts** page and click the **Security & Authentication** tab
3. Check the **Enable Single Sign-On** box
4. Configure the **Setup Single Sign-On** fields according to the following settings and click the **Save** button:

   | **Login Page URL** | https://app.onelogin.com/trust/saml2/http-post/sso/440469 |
   | :--- | :--- |
   | **Logout Page URL** | Optional, see below |
   | **Identity Provider Issuer** | https://app.onelogin.com/saml/metadata/440469 |
   | **Service Provider Issuer** | http://www.thousandeyes.com |
   | **Verification Certificate** | The certificate downloaded from Step 5 in the **Identity Provider configuration** section below |

**IMPORTANT:** Ensure that the **Service Provider Issuer** field reflects the value set by the identity provider in the AudienceRestriction element of the SAML response. Any mismatch, including a protocol mismatch \(http vs https\) will cause the request to be rejected.

**NOTE:** The **Logout Page URL** is optional. If used, the URL should point to the page you wish your users to see when logging out of ThousandEyes.

## Connection details for troubleshooting

If your single sign-on login fails, verify that certain SAML settings are configured as below:

* * Request Compression: Yes
  * Assertion: Unsigned
  * Response: Signed
  * Destination: [http://www.thousandeyes.com](http://www.thousandeyes.com/)
  * AuthnContextClassRef: PasswordProtectedTransport
  * AudienceRestriction: [http://www.thousandeyes.com](http://www.thousandeyes.com/)

    _Note: The AudienceRestriction element generated by your identity provider's configuration must match exactly_ the value set for the Service Provider Issuer field in ThousandEyes.  Any mismatch, including a protocol mismatch \(http vs https\) will cause the request to be rejected.
