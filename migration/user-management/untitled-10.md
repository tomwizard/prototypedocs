# Adding a Profile Image with Gravatar

Have you noticed that when a member of the Customer Success Center responds to your email request, each member has a cool avatar \(profile picture\)? This feature is provided by Gravatar, a free service that is also available to customers. If you would like to use an avatar that is available to many applications, just follow the simple instructions listed below.
