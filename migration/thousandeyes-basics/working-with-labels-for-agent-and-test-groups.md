# Working with Labels for Agent and Test Groups

## Working with Labels for Agent and Test Groups

Administrators can define labels of tests or agents so they can be quickly selected to assign to specific contexts. You can use labeling to group an Agent to test assignment and test filtering, as well as other areas. 

To manage your groups, browse to the **Cloud & Enterprise Agents** section and Click on:

* [Test Labels](https://app.thousandeyes.com/settings/tests/?tab=labels) tab of **Test Settings** to manage test based grouping OR
* [Agent Labels](https://app.thousandeyes.com/settings/agents/labels/?section=agents) tab of **Agent Settings** to manage Cloud & Enterprise Agent based grouping.

Once your Agents or Tests have been assigned labels, these groups can be used to quickly assign Agents to Tests or vice versa.

If you make a mistake adding something, or need to remove an Agent or Test from a particular grouping you are labeling, simply find the Agent or Test in the main list, then click the listing or arrow on left hand side to open the detail.  To view all selected Agent\(s\) or Test\(s\) click "Selected" just below the "Searching" field.  Selected items can be deselected or you can Search and add new items to add.

Labels can also be duplicated for usage where a particular grouping can be preloaded and then more quickly edited using attributes from the copied label.  Select **Duplicate** from the drop down menu and the Copy will appear below.  You can then rename it and change it according to the desired grouping requirements.

The Duplicate can be edited and customized from the original.
